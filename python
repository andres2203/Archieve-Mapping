Usage: create-cracklib-dict [options] wordlist ...

This script takes one or more word list files as arguments
and converts them into cracklib dictionaries for use
by password checking programs. The results are placed in
the default compiled-in dictionary location.

If you wish to store the dictionary in a different location,
use the cracklib-format and cracklib-packer commands directly.

Options:
  -o, --output <file>   Alternative output file for cracklib-packer
  -h, --help            This help output

Example:
create-cracklib-dict /usr/share/words
