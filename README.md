# Archieve-Mapping
Mapping of geo-located archieve files

Inspired by the idea of having a bundle of old archivated plots and maps you want to digitalize. 
0. In first instance the map description (name, adress, location,...) has to be read (OCR) and saved as JSON-file (.txt) inside the folder
1. A file crawler searches for specific files and collects them
2. Locations are mapped in a interactive GUI
